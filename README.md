# Programming-Chipset-System
> Create a * **Chipset** *  that can be slot in the processor or main-program.

## Architecture
1. First step , we need to designing a class that can to expand another class and using internal function to do something.

2. So we can thinking that the **Main-Chip** having **pre-display** , and according to what chip we installed on the slot , then show current chips output data on current slotdata displayer.

3. By using this way , we can connect many chips like logic-gate IC circuit , so we can also designing the slots **having I/O** .
At now , the external chips can receive the data sending by Main-Chip and also can sending a message to Main-Chip to complete a **Conversation**.
